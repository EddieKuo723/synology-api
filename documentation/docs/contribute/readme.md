# Contributing to synology-api  
First things first—**many thanks** for contributing!  
I know it is not easy to spend **free time** contributing to a passion!  

The **very** little guidelines written here are just the **basis** on how to contribute to this package.  

As I say, the following are just _guidelines_, so do not feel obligated—**except for the docs, please _follow_ the docs guidelines :)**  

## 📝 Documentation
Documentation is **important**, especially in this **end-user focused** package, so please take a look at the [**Documentation Guidelines**](docs_guidelines).  

## 😁 Be Cool 
Take a moment to check out our [**Code of Conduct**](conduct_code).  

## 🛠️ Testing  
You should **test your code** on your **Synology NAS** (_if you own one_). This would save us **plenty of time** before merging any of your **pull requests**.  

It does not mean that we will not test it before, but it makes the process **a lot easier** and creates **fewer open pull requests**, which means **less hassle** and review.  

## 🌐 Pull Request 
Check if there is an **active branch** in progress and **always** make sure you are pulling into the **right branch**.  

Before creating a **PR**, make sure **not** to change the **setup, license,** or any other **non-code-related file**.  
Changing them would only slow down the process, requiring **modifications to the PR**.  

## 🫵 We Want You!
We need **volunteers**, so you may be the **one**!  

If you contribute, **we will grow**, which means this package will become even **better**.  
Do not be **scared or shy** to make a **pull request** and/or let us know how we may **improve** this wrapper.
