    '''
       Cloud Sync API implementation.

       This API provides the functionality to get information related to the package settings and current connections and tasks. 
       It also provides functionalities to set most of the settings for tasks and package configuration, as well as manage the current syncing processes.

       Due to the vast amount of public clouds available in the project, the API was not tested for every cloud scenario, so some params request may be missing in specific not tested clouds.

       The tested clouds so far are:
       - Google Drive  
       - OneDrive
       - DropBox
